  <h1> 👋 Hi, I’m Sepehr</h1>
  <h2>📖 My Story</h2>
  <article>
    <p>Picked up <span title="Python! btw, why <abbr> is not working here?">🐍</span> at the start of the COVID-19
      outbreak. I was fascinated by the potential of coding, particularly
      creating algorithms to solve problems. I enjoyed the process of building things through code. However, I
      eventually
      returned to my main focus of content writing and video/sound editing.
    </p>
    <p>I sparked an interest in web development in <time datetime="March 2024">March 2024</time> (1403 Nowrooz) after reconnecting with an old friend from
      my
      hometown who works in the field. Inspired by their experience and seeing others I know succeed in web development,
      I
      decided to pursue this path myself. I began learning front-end development (slef-tought) in <time datetime="April 2024">April 2024</time> and am actively building
      my
      skills in this area.

    <h2>🪆 Beyond Coding</h2>
    <p>I bring a diverse skillset to the table beyond coding.  I hold a degree in Theater from the University of Tehran, where I directed two productions.  My creative side also extends to music, where I play the accordion and am a devoted music enthusiast.For a more detailed look at my writing and editing experience, check out my resume on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sepehr-san/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
